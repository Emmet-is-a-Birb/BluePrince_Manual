# BluePrince_Manual
A manual for blue prince built off of the one made by Zulax.

This Manual requires use of a save editor to edit the save file at "\AppData\LocalLow\Dogubomb\BLUE PRINCE\storage", in order to edit said save file use an editor like https://es3.tusinean.ro.
While not required some mods will make things go smoother/allow access to more filler items, the mods are as listed.

# You are expected to go out of logic
There is a hidden category of items referred to as gem items, alot of checks are out of logic until you have a certain amount of these items in your pool, the amount needed will be next to the check. The Gem items are as listed.
- Sledgehammer
- Keycard
- Metal Detector
- Shovel
- Lockpick Kit
- Lucky Rabbit's Foot
- Parlor Boxes
- Dartboard Puzzle
- Laboratory Terminal
- Dinner (Dining Room)
- Observatory Telescope
- Comissary Stock
- Apple Orchard Gate
- Gemstone Cavern

# Extras
In order to goal you will need 10 Room 46 Key Fragments.
I personally recommend starting off with 3-5 dice if using mods to speed up early game.
Throne Room is already ascended, The Royal Scepter is in the Trove even before added to the pool, The Pool has 2 trunks in the water, Dining Room has the lunch box, And a couple of hard to draft rooms are a better rarity to start off with
If you need help save editing don't feel bad pinging me with @emmet_is_a_birb in the blue prince thread https://discord.com/channels/1097532591650910289/1371121608873349130

# The To-do List
- Add some traps to the pool, currently got Instantly End Day, No Rerolling for Two Proper Days, Cursed for Two Proper Days
- Find a way to have the Crown of Blueprints spawn in the item pool in rooms like Master Bedroom, Throne Room, And The Office
- Find a way to get the Gift Shop to spawn before room 46 so every room is a check
- Readd the Antechamber goal which i think was in the original manual
